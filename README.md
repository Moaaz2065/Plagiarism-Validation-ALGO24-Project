# Plagiarism-Validation-ALGO24-Project

## Overview
In our project, we leverage MOSS (Measure of Software Similarity), a system designed to detect similarities in software. Our goal is to enhance the review process by making it more efficient and manageable for evaluators. MOSS helps us identify matching pairs that exhibit similarities. However, among these pairs, some matches are deemed insignificant, and cyclical patterns can emergeâ€”for instance, if file 1 is similar to file 2, file 2 to file 3, and file 3 back to file 1, creating a cycle. The aim of our project is to address these issues by filtering out such cycles and prioritizing the matching pairs that show the highest degree of similarity, while disregarding the lower and less consequential pairs that do not significantly impact the analysis.

To achieve this, we propose an optimized approach that not only identifies all connected components within the similarity graph generated by MOSS but also refines these components by removing cycles. This refinement process involves constructing a Maximum Spanning Tree (MST) for each component, focusing on the edges with the highest similarity scores to eliminate redundancy. By doing so, we can ensure that the evaluators are presented with the most pertinent and impactful matches, streamlining the review process, and enhancing the overall efficiency of similarity detection.

This project is expected to significantly reduce the workload on evaluators by automating the process of sifting through numerous matches to identify the ones that truly matter. Through intelligent filtering and prioritization, we can focus on the similarities that warrant further investigation, thereby making the best use of the evaluators' time and resources.
